## 25. Differential Equations

1. Solve the following first-order ordinary differential equations:
   - $y'(x)= y$
   - $y'(x) = \frac{1}{2y(x)}$
  
3. Solve the first-order ordinary differential equations using the method of separation of variables for $x$ and $y=y(x)$:

   - $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{y}$
   - $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x}$
   - $\frac{dy}{dx} = xy$

4. Solve the second-order ordinary differential equations:

   * $y''(x) + y'(x) = 0$, with boundary conditions $y(0) = 2$ and $y'(0) = -1$

   * $y''(x) - y(x)= 0$, with boundary conditions $y(0) = 2$ and $y'(0) = 0$

   * $\frac{d^2\,y(x)}{dx^2} = -\omega^2 y(x)$.

5. Check if the function $\psi(t, x) = A \cos(\omega t + kx)$ is a solution of the second-order partial differential equation (the so-called "wave equation"), where $v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{2\pi / T}{2\pi / \lambda}$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial t^2} - v^2 \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial x^2} = 0.
$$
