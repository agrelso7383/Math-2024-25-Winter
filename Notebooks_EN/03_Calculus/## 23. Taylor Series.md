## 23. Taylor Series

1. **Find the Taylor series and visualize obtained functions in Geogebra**:

### $For \( f(x) = \cos(x) \) around \( x = 0 \) up to the 4th degree$:
   The Taylor series expansion is:
   
$f(x) = \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24}$

Now, we substitue and give the solutions:
$\( f(x) = \cos(x) \)** around \( x = 0 \)$:
- $\( f(0) = 1 \)$ 
- $\( f'(0) = 0 \)$ 
- $\( f''(0) = -1 \)$ 
- $\( f^{(4)}(0) = 1 \)$ 
- $Expansion substituting in the Taylor formula: \( 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24}$
  
### $For \( h(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \) around \( x = 0 \) up to the 4th degree$:
   The Taylor series expansion is:
  
As the function is already in the form of a geometric series, we didn't have to operate as before
$h(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \approx 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4$
   
### $For \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) around \( x = \pi \) up to the 4th degree$:
   The Taylor series expansion is:
   
$g(x) = -\left( (x-\pi) - \frac{(x-\pi)^3}{3!} \right) = -(x-\pi) + \frac{(x-\pi)^3}{6}$

- Shift to expand arpund x=0 adding the t: $\( x = t + \pi \) = \( \sin(t+\pi) = -\sin(t) \)$ 
- Now, we find the Taylor Series of $-sin(t)$ around $t=0$: $\( -(t - \frac{t^3}{3!})$
- Then, we substitute $t= (x- /pi)$: $-(x - \pi) + \frac{(x - \pi)^3}{6} \)$

2. **Find a tangent line** $\( y = f'(x_0) (x-x_0) + f(x_0) \)$ **to the function** $\( f(x) = e^{\sin(x)} \) **at** \( x_0 = \pi \)$:

First, compute $\( f'(x) \)$:

-We find the derivative: 

$f(x) = e^{\sin(x)}$
$f'(x) = e^{\sin(x)} \cos(x)$

Now, evaluate at \( x_0 = \pi \):
   
$f(\pi) = e^{\sin(\pi)} = e^0 = 1$
$f'(\pi) = e^{\sin(\pi)} \cos(\pi) = 1 \cdot (-1) = -1$

   Therefore, the tangent line is:

$f'(\pi) \cdot (x-\pi) + f (\pi)$
$y = -1 \cdot (x - \pi) + 1 = -x + \pi + 1$
