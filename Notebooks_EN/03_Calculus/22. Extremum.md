### Optimization and Extremum Problems

#### 1. The profit function is $P(u) = -2u^2 + 50u - 300$, where $u$ is the number of units sold. Find the number of units that maximize profit.

**Solution:**  
The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola represented by $P(u)$. The formula for the $u$-coordinate of the vertex is given by:  
$u = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $P(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.

Here, $a = -2$, $b = 50$, and $c = -300$. Substituting:  
$u = -\frac{50}{2(-2)} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5$.

Thus, the number of units that maximize profit is **12.5 units**.

#### 2. You have 10 meters of string, and you need to use it to enclose the largest possible rectangle. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**  
Let the rectangle's dimensions be $x$ and $y$. The perimeter is $2x + 2y = 10$, or equivalently, $x + y = 5$. The area of the rectangle is $A = x \cdot y$.

Substitute $y = 5 - x$ into $A$:  
$A(x) = x(5 - x) = 5x - x^2$.

To find the maximum area, take the derivative of $A(x)$:  
$A'(x) = 5 - 2x$.

Set $A'(x) = 0$:  
$5 - 2x = 0 \implies x = 2.5$.

When $x = 2.5$, $y = 5 - 2.5 = 2.5$.  
Thus, the dimensions of the rectangle are **2.5 meters by 2.5 meters**, forming a square.

#### 3. Find the extremum of $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5$.

**Solution:**  
The function $f(x)$ is a parabola that opens upwards (as the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive). Its extremum is a minimum, which occurs at the vertex. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is:  
$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a = 1$ and $b = 3$.  

Substitute:  
$x = -\frac{3}{2(1)} = -\frac{3}{2}$.

The minimum value is:  
$f(-\frac{3}{2}) = (-\frac{3}{2})^2 + 3(-\frac{3}{2}) - 5 = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} - 5 = -\frac{29}{4}$.

Thus, the minimum occurs at $x = -\frac{3}{2}$, with a value of $f(x) = -\frac{29}{4}$.

#### 4. Find the extremum of $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x - 1}$.

**Solution:**  
Rewrite the function:  
$f(x) = \frac{(x + 1)^2}{x - 1}$.

To find critical points, calculate $f'(x)$ using the quotient rule:  
$f'(x) = \frac{(x - 1) \cdot 2(x + 1) - (x + 1)^2 \cdot 1}{(x - 1)^2} = \frac{2(x + 1)(x - 1) - (x + 1)^2}{(x - 1)^2}$.

Simplify the numerator:  
$2(x + 1)(x - 1) - (x + 1)^2 = 2(x^2 - 1) - (x^2 + 2x + 1) = 2x^2 - 2 - x^2 - 2x - 1 = x^2 - 2x - 3$.

Thus,  
$f'(x) = \frac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{(x - 1)^2}$.

Set $f'(x) = 0$:  
$x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$. Solve using factoring:  
$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \implies x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Check the behavior of $f(x)$ near these points to classify extrema. Note that $x = 1$ is a vertical asymptote, and $f(x)$ approaches $\pm\infty$ as $x \to 1^\pm$.

- At $x = 3$: Compute $f(3) = \frac{(3 + 1)^2}{3 - 1} = \frac{16}{2} = 8$.  
- At $x = -1$: Compute $f(-1) = \frac{((-1) + 1)^2}{-1 - 1} = \frac{0}{-2} = 0$.

Thus, $f(x)$ has a **maximum** at $x = 3$ with $f(3) = 8$ and a **minimum** at $x = -1$ with $f(-1) = 0$.
