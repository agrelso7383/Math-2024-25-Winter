The general equation of a sphere is:  
\[
$(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 = r^2$
\]

For the sphere with center \( P = (1, 2, 3) \) and radius \( r = 3 \):  
\[
$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 3)^2 = 9$
\]

Final Equation:  
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 3)^2 = 9
\]

## Do the Spheres \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2 \) Have Common Points?

- The two spheres have different radio, and their centers are at the origin (\( (0, 0, 0) \)).
- Since their radi0 is different, they don't intersect.
- **Conclusion**: The spheres have no common points.

## Intersection of the Spheres \$( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \)$ and \$( (x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \)$

Given Sphere Equations:
1. \$( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \)$
2. \$( (x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \)$

To find the intersection, substitute ( x = 1/2) (the midpoint between the centers) into the first sphere equation and simpplify. 

Final Equation of the Curve:  
\[
x = 1/2, $y^2 + z^2 = 3/4$
\]

## Equation of the Tangent Plane to the Paraboloid at \( P = (1, 0, 1) \)

Paraboloid Equation:
\[
$z = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + 1$
\]

- \( \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2(x - 1) \)  
- \( \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2y \)

At point \( P = (1, 0, 1) \):  
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \bigg|_{(1, 0)} = 2(1 - 1) = 0
\]  
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \bigg|_{(1, 0)} = 2(0) = 0
\]

The tangent plane at \( P \) is given by:  
\[
z - z_0 = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} (x - x_0) + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} (y - y_0)
\]

Substitute \( z_0 = 1 \), \( \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 0 \), and \( \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 0 \):  
\[
z - 1 = 0(x - 1) + 0(y - 0)
\]

Final Equation of the Tangent Plane:
\[
z = 1
\]
